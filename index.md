I am a phD student working at the [Laboratoire de Géologie] [LG] in [Ecole Normale Supérieure] [ENS].

I look at surface deformation with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) 
and GPS to study the dynamics of active continental fault zone. Together with the physical understanding 
of the earthquake cycle, I am interested in methodological improvements for automatic processing of 
large amount of observations.
