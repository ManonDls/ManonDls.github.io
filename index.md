**Welcome to my Website !**


I am a PhD student in Geophysics under the supervision of Dr. [Romain Jolivet] [ROMAIN]
at the [Laboratoire de Géologie] [LG] in [Ecole Normale Supérieure] [ENS].

I look at the deformation of Earth's surface with satelitte Radar images (more specifically, with InSAR) and GPS 
to study the dynamics of active continental fault zone. Together with the physical understanding 
of the earthquake cycle, I am interested in methodological improvements for automatic processing of 
large amount of observations. 

In my current research, I focus on the Chaman fault zone, in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
