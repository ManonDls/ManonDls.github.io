### Codes

**KFTS**

Time series analysis for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) with a data assimilation approach. 
The algorithm is based on a Kalman smoother and designed for tectonic applications. 
The [source code][KFsource] is freely available and regularly updated ([documentation][KFdoc]).

### Field work
